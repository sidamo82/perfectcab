# PERFECTCAB

Welcome to the PerfectCab Project!

This project is born to help you to configure your machine with the  main goal to play games with its own native resolution: with  "PerfectCab" you can play your favorites games with the best emulation  accuracy.

The operating system is completely hidden to end-user: you don’t see  any Windows or Linux logo at power-on. Just give power to your cabinet,  wait approx 30 seconds, and you are ready to select your favorite games.

Just follow the step-by-step procedure described in these pages and you will configure your own "Pixel Perfect" arcade cabinet!

- Lower hardware requirements: you can confidently install "PerfectCab" on "10 years old" PC
- Run games at their native resolution (CRT monitor is needed)
- Automatically switching resolution for each game
- Best emulators are chosen based on their accuracy
- OS underlying hidden to end-user: power-on the cabinet and you  directly see "AttractMode" frontend layout. No booting up messages or  ubuntu startup logos.
- Easy Power-On: Just give power to your arcade cabinet, wait approx 30 seconds, and the system is ready to use.
- Easy Power-Off: Just exit to PerfectCab and your PC automatically  powered off. You have only to switch off power from the arcade cabinet.
